        <h1>Location and how to get there</h1>
        <div class="media"> <img src="image/div.png" alt="break" width="100%"> </div>
        <p>
            We will be getting married at De Landgoederij: 
                De Landgoederij
                Camminghalaan 30
                3981 GH BUNNIK
        </p>
        <h3>By car</h3>
        <p>
            You can use the above address for navigation. Parking is available at the location.
        </p>
        <h3>By taxi</h3>
        <p> 
            If you prefer to take a taxi, we strongly recommend you reserve one in advance, for example through <a href="http://www.utc.nl/">UTC</a>. They tend to have long waiting times at night, especially on the weekend. 
        </p>
        <h3>By public transport</h3>
        <p> 
            The Landgoederij is about a 15 minute walk from Bunnik train station. Bunnik train station has regular connections to Utrecht Central Station (please be aware that the last trains stop running before the end of the party). Please check the current schedule at <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en">NS</a>. <a href="https://maps.google.com/">Google Maps</a> generally gives reliable information on public transport too.
        </p>
        <h3>By bike</h3>
        <p> 
            It’s not around the corner, but if you’re feeling active the Landgoederij is around a 25 minute bike ride from Utrecht Central Station.

        <h3>Suggestions on where to stay</h3>
        <p> 
            Utrecht there are many hotels (to find one see for example <a href="https://booking.com">Booking.com</a>) and AirBnBs. Do take into mind that parking options in Utrecht might be limited/more expensive. Hotels in Bunnik are limited (<a href="https://www.postillionhotels.com/en-gb/hotels/postillion-hotel-utrecht-bunnik">Postillion Hotel Utrecht Bunnik</a> is the nearest hotel: 5 min by car, 25 min by foot). Our suggestion would be to stay either in Utrecht or in Bunnik. 
        </p>

        <h3>Dress code</h3>
        <p>
            We would love for everyone to dress up for a fun, summer wedding. So basically feel free to wear what you think is appropriate for a wedding (as long as you can dance in it!).
        </p>

        <h3>The wedding program and speeches</h3>
        <p>
            We want to keep the program limited, so that everyone has enough time to talk to each other, laugh and dance. If you want to say something, please get in touch with us and we can see how and where we can fit it into the program.

        </p>

        <h3>Gift wishes</h3>
        <p>
            Just having you at the wedding is a gift in itself - so don’t feel obliged to bring something! If you'd really like to gift us something, we would be happy with a financial contribution towards redecorating our home (current home or if we’re very lucky a new place).
